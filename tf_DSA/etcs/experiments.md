# Trained Models & Performances

## Models

I have tried multiple variations of models to find optmized network architecture. Some of them are below and checkpoint files are provided for research purpose.

- cmu
  - the model based VGG pretrained network which described in the original paper.
  - I converted Weights in Caffe format to use in tensorflow.
  - [pretrained weight download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xh5s7sb7remu8tx/openpose_coco.npy?dl=0)

- dsconv
  - Same architecture as the cmu version except for the **depthwise separable convolution** of mobilenet.
  - I trained it using 'transfer learning', but it provides not-enough speed and accuracy.

- mobilenet
  - Based on the mobilenet paper, 12 convolutional layers are used as feature-extraction layers.
  - To improve on small person, **minor modification** on the architecture have been made.
  - Three models were learned according to network size parameters.
    - mobilenet
      - 368x368 : [checkpoint weight download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/09xivpuboecge56/mobilenet_0.75_0.50_model-388003.zip?dl=0)
    - mobilenet_fast
    - mobilenet_accurate
  - I published models which is not the best ones, but you can test them before you trained a model from the scratch.

- mobilenet v2
  - Similar to mobilenet, but using improved version of it.

- I also ran keras & caffe models to verify single-scale version's performance, they matched this result.

Optimized Tensorflow was built before run this experiment. This may varies between environments, images and other factors.
